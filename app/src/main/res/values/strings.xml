    <string name="Title">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban </string>

    <string name="Review">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the third instalment in the Harry Potter series,
        and is by the incomparable JK Rowling. The Harry Potter series are described as children books, however, in my opinion,
        whether you are twelve or twenty two, I highly recommend them!!
        Now after a long summer (and some aunt abusing antics), Harry is back at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,with his trusty best friends: Ron and Hermione. Yet, secret and mysterious things are happening in the wizarding world,
        and Harry is not safe from the dark and dangerous people at large. Who is the infamous Sirius Black, who escaped from the notorious wizard prison:
        Azkaban? </string>
